# Introduction

## Linux
Windows, made by Microsoft, is a well-known operating system mostly using Desktop environments, but there are other alternatives as well. One of the more popular ones are MacOSX, ChromeOS and, of course, Linux. Linux, using a desktop environment, is less prominent than the others.

In Server / IOT / mobile environments, a certain shift in used operating systems occurred. Linux is one of the most popular operating systems in these markets. Some interesting statements:

* [The most popular cloud infrastructure providers use Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/how-amazon-web-services-uses-linux-and-open-source/)

Linux is used in smartphones, (web) servers, tablets, IoT devices, Smart washing machines, self driving cars, modems, routers, PlayStation, ... In brief: Linux is used way more than you would initially think. Linux even has his own mascotte, the penguin named Tux!

### Unix
Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson created the Unix operating system in 1969. The source code from this OS was was shared at that time. After a while the company AT&T Bell Labs decided they wanted to sell Unix commercially. BSD further developed UNIX independently from UNIX. This led to subsequent versions:
* Unix: The commercial version
* BSD Unix: The open source version

In the '80 there were different versions of Unix. Because Unix was commercialized, the source code of Unix were rewritten: GNU project ("GNU is not unix")_. The goal of GNU was the development of an open source operating system where everyone could work on together as a community. The GNU project was missing a kernel.

### Linux
A student named Linus Torvalds created a post in a newsgroup about his own operating system in the '90:

We are still using the Linux kernel today. The kernel is being further developed every day.

#### Linux distributions
Linux distributions (distros in short) use an installer (anaconda for instance) to install the Linux kernel, the GNU utilities and a lot of other applications. Every distro is made for a certain purpose. Some well known distros are Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, Archlinux, Oracle Linux ...
