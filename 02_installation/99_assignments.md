# Assignment CH2
## Task 1
Linux also has a desktop version. Download and install [Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) in a new virtual machine and explore the interface.

## Task 2
In the Ubuntu desktop machine, try to execute the following subtasks:
- Try to add a user with your name.
- Create a new text file with the tool "Text Editor" (=gedit).
- Pin the Terminal -application to the Dock (=launcher).
- Configure the Thunderbird app to use your school email.
- Surf to the school website.

This is all we are going to do with the Desktop version. The focus of this course is towards the Server version. So it is safe to delete this virtual machine if you don't want to explore any further.
