# What's next

## Server in the Cloud
Linus wants to bring his server to the Cloud so that multiple persons can play the game together. But first he needs to know how to create a server in the Cloud. He has already heard about AWS and wants to figure out how this platform works. He wants to run a Ubuntu Server in the Cloud.

## MineCraft Server in the Cloud
Now that Linus has a Ubuntu Server running in the Cloud he wants to make a MineCraft Server from it. 

## Webserver in the Cloud
Linus also wants to have a Website showing his MineCraft Server to the World. He wants to create a second server in the Cloud that will be used for serving the Website. He doesn't know much about HTML and CSS, so he will search for a template that he can alter to his needs.

## Webserver security
Most Websites run over https by using SSL/TLS to add a security layer. Linus will implement this feature for his webserver. He also wants his Website to be accessible with a DNS name. This is because of the fact that people do remind URLs with specific names (www.name.org) easier than IP addresses (187.34.21.45).
